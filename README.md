# Fraud-Detection-App

This project implements a machine learning-based fraud detection system for financial transactions. It includes a Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training, a Streamlit web application for interactive fraud predictions, and a dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanalisiddiqui/fraud-detection-dataset/data). The model leverages logistic regression with balanced class weights to address the imbalanced nature of fraud data, achieving high recall for detecting fraudulent transactions.

Project Overview
The Fraud Detection Project aims to identify fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning. The Jupyter notebook (notebooks/Analysis_Model.ipynb) performs EDA, data preprocessing, and trains a logistic regression model to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The Streamlit app (src/app.py) provides a user-friendly interface to input transaction details and receive real-time fraud predictions.

Key features:

Analysis of transaction data with features like step, type, amount, and isFraud.
Logistic regression model with balanced class weights to handle imbalanced data (0.13% fraud rate).
Interactive web app for fraud prediction.
Dataset
The dataset (data/AIML Dataset.csv) contains 6,362,620 financial transaction records with the following key columns:

step: Time step of the transaction.
type: Transaction type (e.g., PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT).
amount: Transaction amount.
oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig: Origin account balances before and after the transaction.
oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest: Destination account balances before and after the transaction.
isFraud: Binary label (1 for fraudulent, 0 for non-fraudulent).
Note: If the dataset exceeds GitHub's 100 MB limit, it is hosted externally. Download it from [Insert External Link, e.g., Google Drive or Kaggle] and place it in the data/ folder.

Model Details
Algorithm: Logistic Regression with class_weight='balanced' to handle the imbalanced dataset (0.13% fraud cases).
Features: step, type (one-hot encoded), amount, oldbalanceOrg, newbalanceOrig, oldbalanceDest, newbalanceDest.
Preprocessing:
Numerical features scaled using StandardScaler.
Categorical feature type encoded using OneHotEncoder.
Performance (on test set):
Accuracy: 94.67%
Fraud class (isFraud=1):
Precision: 0.02 (low due to imbalance)
Recall: 0.94 (high, good at detecting fraud)
F1-Score: 0.04
See notebooks/Analysis_Model.ipynb for detailed metrics and confusion matrix.
Limitations:

Low precision for fraud due to class imbalance.
Future improvements: Use SMOTE for oversampling, test ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), or tune hyperparameters.
